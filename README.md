> ⚠️ **Important: Check Azure OpenAI Quota Availability**
 <br/>To ensure sufficient quota is available in your subscription, please follow [quota check instructions guide](./docs/DeploymentGuide.md#regional-availability) before you deploy the solution.

<br/>

### Prerequisites and costs

To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups, resources, app registrations, and assign roles at the resource group level**. This should include Contributor role at the subscription level and  Role Based Access Control role on the subscription and/or resource group level. Follow the steps in [Azure Account Set Up](./docs/AzureAccountSetUp.md).

*Note: Due to model availability within various data center regions, the following services have been hard-coded to specific regions:*

* **Azure Open AI (GPT 4o mini):**<br>
The solution relies on `GPT-4o mini` and `text-embedding-3-large` models which are all currently available in the 'WestUS3', 'EastUS', 'EastUS2', 'SwedenCentral' region.  
Please check the
[model summary table and region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#embeddings) if needed.

* **Azure AI Document Intelligence (East US):**<br>
The solution relies on a `2023-10-31-preview` or later that is currently available in `East US` region.  
The deployment region for this model is fixed in 'East US'

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) page and select a **region** where the following services are available.

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage. The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers. However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) to calculate the cost of this solution in your subscription. 

Review a [sample pricing sheet](https://azure.com/e/94cf771516ec4812b36c5f2e3e6b4121) in the event you want to customize and scale usage.

_Note: This is not meant to outline all costs as selected SKUs, scaled use, customizations, and integrations into your own tenant can affect the total consumption of this sample solution. The sample pricing sheet is meant to give you a starting point to customize the estimate for your specific needs._

Business use case
</h2>

<br/>

In large, enterprise organizations it's difficult and time consuming to analyze large volumes of data. Imagine a mortgage lender working with both residential and commercial clients and she facilitates financing for buyers and sellers by negotiating loan terms, processing mortgage applications, and ensures compliance with federal regulations.

Her challenges include:

* Analyzing large volumes of data in a timely manner, limiting quick decision-making.​
* Inability to compare and synthesize documents limits the contextual relevance of insights.​
* Inability to extract information from charts and tables leads to incomplete analysis and poor decision-making.

The goal of this solution accelerator is to:
* Automate document ingestion to avoid missing critical terms and ensure accuracy.​
* Leverage extracted data to make better-informed loan decisions.​
* Accelerate loan approvals while reducing manual effort.

⚠️ The sample data used in this repository is synthetic and generated using Azure OpenAI service. The data is intended for use as sample data only.

### Security guidelines

This template uses Azure Key Vault to store all connections to communicate between resources.

This template also uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for local development and deployment.

To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

* Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud to [secure your Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/).
* Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).
